Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos

## My process

I started by writing out the HTML code and breaking the code into React components. Then I wrote the React functionality and finally the CSS code.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flex
- Responsive design with fluid typography
- [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/css/) - BEM Methodology
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - Sass documentation


### What I learned

This was my first attempt at writing a todo app. I learned more about map and filter functions in React and how to implement drag and drop functionality. I did this with the help of the react-beautiful-dnd. 


### Continued development

Continue to do Frontend Mentor challenges with React.
